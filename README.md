# CarDetection
The weights of the model can be found on yolov5\runs\train\exp\weights this includes the pytorch model, as well as the tfjs converted model. I performed the training of the model on Google Colab as well as the conversion as I ran into errors while trying to convert it locally.

To run the React App, go to package.json, open a new terminal and run npm install. 
After that you can do npm start.
There are still errors in the application so it will result to crashes.
The model that I've pointed to is contained in another github repo (https://github.com/Pocketloop/TFJSModel/blob/main/best_web_model/model.json) and it's the raw version of that
