# CarDetection
The weights of the model can be found on web_model_tfjs. The web app is working properly, however the accuracy of the model could be better. The detections were able to be logged in the browser and there should be no problem with it, I have implemented the 3D model, and the boxes that detect the cars, however, I can't get the web app to detect the cars even though there aren't any errors that pop up, please take a look through the code as I'm unsure of where the errors are. The link that I have pointed the model to be is (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pocketloop/TFJSModel/main/converted/model.json)
