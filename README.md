# CarDetection
The weights of the model can be found on yolov5\runs\train\exp\weights this includes the pytorch model, as well as the tfjs converted model. I performed the training of the model on Google Colab as well as the conversion as I ran into errors while trying to convert it locally.

To run the React App, go to package.json, open a new terminal and run npm install. 
After that you can do npm start.
There are still errors in the application so it will result to crashes.
